FIXES:
	- the syntax definition for Terms was adapted to the changes made in SetlX v2.5.0
	- some parts of the syntax definition were moved around and reorganized to hopefully provide a more reliable system
	- removed the directory for the VS Code-Version of this extension out of the master branch to avoid interference
