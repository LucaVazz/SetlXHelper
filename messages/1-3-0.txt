FIXED:
- fixed keyword highlighting
    previously keywords inside variable names were also wrongly highlighted
    (i.e. `in` inside `insert`)

NEW FEATURES:
- now also compatible with TextMate and IntelliJ IDEA (as a `.tmbundle`)
    see https://github.com/LucaVazz/SetlXHelper/blob/1.3.0/README.md for instructions
